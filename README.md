Knucklebones is a mini-game featured in the 2022 rougelike videogame [Cult of the Lamb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Lamb). This is a recreation of the game, implemented using SwiftUI and assets from the original game (taken from the Cult of the Lamb [official wiki](https://cult-of-the-lamb.fandom.com/wiki/Cult_of_the_Lamb_Wiki))

## Implementation

## Asset Usage
This project was created for educational purposes, as a term project for an iOS development class at the University of Houston. All assets (animated gifs, images, etc.) are property of the Cult of the Lamb team. This project was created for educational purposes; the use of this project's code or assets for profit is not permitted, as this would violate Fair Use copywright protections for the usage of the original game's assets.

The "Knucklebones" title image was adapted from the "Knuckleclone" title of [Nafeij's web-based recreation](https://github.com/Nafeij/kbclone).
